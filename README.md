This repository contains the complete implementation of Task 4 from my ApexPlanet Internship,
which includes three fully functional web projects built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
The Portfolio website showcases my skills, projects, and personal information in a clean 
and responsive layout. The To-Do and Note-Taking App allows users to manage tasks and 
notes with features like add, delete, mark completed, filter, and LocalStorage persistence. 
The Product Listing Page provides an interactive interface where users can search,
filter by category, price, and rating, and sort products dynamically. Each project 
is organized in its own folder and can be run directly by opening the corresponding index.html file.
